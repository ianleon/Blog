# Using SwiftUI to make a camera app

I've always wanted to make a camera app. 

I always suspected that the iPhone hardware and the building blocks that Apple gives us in their API had a multitude of options and settings that common camera apps do not expose. My goal is to create a camera app that exposes and exercises everything in the hardware and in the API without too much regard for user experience or user interface.

To make this challenging, I have decided to build this app in SwiftUI. There aren't any SwiftUI components for AVKit. Therefore, I will have to use `Framework Integration` with `UIKit`.

This app will become my testing ground / laboratory for exploring other image related technology in iOS. For example, I will be using Core Image, Vision, Metal, ARKit, and anything else that might come along.
